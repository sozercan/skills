# Autoreview

This directory tracks the OpenClaw `autoreview` runtime with three narrow downstream behavior overrides.

## Upstream

- Repository: [`openclaw/agent-skills`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills)
- Source snapshot: [`skills/autoreview` at commit `bae9b204f937991b45c3fd68d5c9dcafb23b9159`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/tree/bae9b204f937991b45c3fd68d5c9dcafb23b9159/skills/autoreview)
- Commit: [`bae9b204f937991b45c3fd68d5c9dcafb23b9159`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/commit/bae9b204f937991b45c3fd68d5c9dcafb23b9159)

The vendored runtime starts from that snapshot and carries only the behavior overrides below.
`AGENTS.md` records the downstream sync policy.

## Local differences

- Codex defaults to `gpt-6.1-sol` with `xhigh` reasoning instead of upstream's `high` reasoning.
- Claude defaults to `claude-opus-5-5` with `xhigh` reasoning instead of upstream's `claude-fable-5` default.
- Codex preserves `openai_base_url` from an external `CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, passes it through an internal OpenAI-compatible provider because isolated runs use `--ignore-user-config`, and disables WebSocket transport for that provider.

No other runtime behavior is intentionally changed.

## Packaging

The upstream test suites, fixtures, and optional `scripts/test-review-harness*` live-provider smoke wrappers are omitted. `scripts/autoreview` does not depend on them. A small downstream test covers only the three local behavior overrides.
