# Autoreview

This directory vendors the OpenClaw `autoreview` skill with three narrow downstream overrides.

## Upstream

- Repository: [`openclaw/agent-skills`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills)
- Source snapshot: [`skills/autoreview` at commit `2a409d348a4bcf6f15e41e9a20efd0b298a32528`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/tree/2a409d348a4bcf6f15e41e9a20efd0b298a32528/skills/autoreview)
- Commit: [`2a409d348a4bcf6f15e41e9a20efd0b298a32528`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/commit/2a409d348a4bcf6f15e41e9a20efd0b298a32528) (`docs(skills): add readme-standard house README skill`, August 2, 2026)

The vendored skill matches that snapshot except for the three overrides below and this provenance README.

## Local differences

- Codex defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol` with `max` reasoning instead of upstream's `high` reasoning.
- Claude defaults to `claude-opus-5` with `max` reasoning instead of upstream's `claude-fable-5` default.
- Codex runs with `--ignore-user-config`, so the downstream copy also preserves `openai_base_url` from the external `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` and passes it as an explicit Codex configuration override.

`SKILL.md` documents all three exceptions. No other skill behavior is intentionally changed.
