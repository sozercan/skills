# Autoreview

This directory vendors the OpenClaw `autoreview` skill with downstream hardening and portability changes.

## Upstream

- Repository: [`openclaw/agent-skills`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills)
- Source snapshot: [`skills/autoreview` at commit `3300b1086017741ad9bb5f00b9cceae4e7354f89`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/tree/3300b1086017741ad9bb5f00b9cceae4e7354f89/skills/autoreview)
- Commit: [`3300b1086017741ad9bb5f00b9cceae4e7354f89`](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/commit/3300b1086017741ad9bb5f00b9cceae4e7354f89) (`fix(autoreview): restrict quoted credential keys (#99)`, July 14, 2026)

OpenClaw's work is used under the MIT License. The full notice is included below so single-skill installations retain it; the repository root also has [`LICENSE`](../../LICENSE).

## Local differences

Compared with the upstream snapshot above:

- Codex defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol` with `max` reasoning instead of upstream's `high` reasoning.
- Non-runtime tests live in [`tests/autoreview`](../../tests/autoreview) so the installed skill payload contains only its documentation and runtime helpers; JVM-specific hardening tests skip when a Java launcher exists but no usable runtime is available.
- Native Windows CI and a PowerShell review-harness launcher are included.
- Bootstrap requires Python 3.9+ and refuses Python, Git, GitHub CLI, reviewer, or PowerShell executables resolved from the reviewed checkout.
- Git reads neutralize repository-controlled filters, replacement refs, hooks, signing, color, submodule ignore settings, diff formatting, and excludes.
- Review-input hardening includes canonical `a/` and `b/` paths, broader secret aliases, escaped untracked paths, combined-diff handling, stable ref snapshots, unambiguous bundle serialization, empty-diff rejection, and cross-platform UTF-8 handling.
- Pull-request bases resolve to commit object IDs rather than assuming an `origin/<branch>` remote-tracking ref.
- Output paths are normalized and guarded against repository collisions and parent-directory replacement during atomic writes.
- Panel deduplication preserves corroborating reviewer identities while retaining the strongest severity and confidence.
- This README embeds the full MIT notice so standalone skill installations retain the upstream license.
